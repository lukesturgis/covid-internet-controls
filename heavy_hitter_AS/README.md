Just run heavy_hitter_list_of_all_AS_in_country_list.sh file. All ASes in the countries and Top 100 ASes file will be created.

ToDo:
1. Design data structure or database to store efficiently tree of p|C|-1.
2. Once tree is designed from step 1 start performing deletion of customer ASes from top 100 list.
3. Test if remaining heavy hitters can cover 90% of internet of country or not.
