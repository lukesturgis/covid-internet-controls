The 643,000 ballots requested in the initial wave in North Carolina were more than 16 times the number the state sent out at the same time four years ago. The requests came overwhelmingly from Democratic and independent voters, a reflection of a new partisan divide over mail voting.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The North Carolina numbers were one more bit of evidence backing up what experts have been predicting for months: Worries about&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak" style="">the virus</a>&nbsp;are likely to push tens of millions of voters to vote by mail for the first time, transforming the way the election is conducted and the vote is counted.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon we are probably going to start seeing the issues we have seen popping up with mail in ballots proving it doesn't work in the battleground state of North Carolina, as we are now getting a report that 643,000 mail in ballots have been requested in the state. A number in this report sticks out showing that this coronahoax Democrat mail in voting scheme is a major plot to steal the election, as these 643,000 mail in ballots requested in North Carolina is a 16 percent jump in mail in ballot requests from the 2016 election. It's pretty obvious to every America that coronavirus was set up in an attempt by a they thought she would win Democrat establishment, when mail in ballot requests in one US State are up sixteen percent from the 2016 election.</font><br /></div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="2">Do Democrats really think that all Black Americans support their activated riots across America or Marxists Black Lives Matter, because if this Rasmussen poll shows anything it shows Democrats and their actions are starting to flip Black America to Trump. A Rasmussen poll that now shows likely black voter approval for President Trump at just below half at 45 percent right before the election, you can guarantee there is deep panic inside the Democrat establishment and their media after Rasmussen has now released that Black American approval for Trump who are likely voters is now at 45%.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If President Trump happens to get 45 percent of the Black vote on Election night, we are probably going to see White Democrats who once claimed to care about Black American's immediately claim that Black America is a bunch of white supremacists. This Rasmussen report detailing 45% of likely black voters now approve of Trump might cause so much distress in Democrat circles...It might force some Democrats to relocate themselves to mental wards. This is horrible news for Democrats it's priceless. Looks like Black America is starting to get over the race tactics of the Democrat establishment and their co-conspirators in the media.</font>

Now as part of the US Marshals Service Operation Safety Net, we are now seeing a successful effort by the US Marshals Service and Indiana authorities that has announced today by the US Marshals Service where eight more children in the Indianapolis, Indiana area have been rescued. The questionable part about this situation while the US Marshals Service and law enforcement officials are saving dozens of abducted, trafficked, and exploited children by the dozens across America, why does the media and the Democrat establishments remain silent? Wait till we get announcements involving this operation involving areas like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. Has anyone noticed yet that these operations are massively taking place in Democrat controlled jurisdictions&nbsp;around America?</font>

The increases in arrests come despite the continuing threat of COVID-19 infection and the almost certainty that under Title 42, they will be returned to Mexico when arrested.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Border Patrol agents arrested 48,864 migrants in August after they illegally crossed the border from Mexico into the U.S., according to the Southwest Border Migration Report released on Friday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.

We are now finding out since April that apprehensions of illegal aliens at the border with Mexico are up for the 4th straight month with a percentage increase of 200 percent since the low point in April. Guarantee there is an attempt by the Democrat establishment and the Globalist establishment to flood our border with Mexico with illegal aliens while we are focused on multiple things taking place in America...Guarantee the Democrat establishment and globalist establishment are very connected to this recent surge of illegal aliens caught at the border since a very low point of illegal alien apprehensions announced in April. Our border is still under seige.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></div>

The district in July restored voting rights to people serving time for felony convictions. Maine and Vermont have similar measures. A D.C. election board official said Wednesday that&nbsp;the agency is working with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to ensure registration forms can be returned fast enough for the inmates to vote.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well it looks like local officials in our nations capitol have now been caught attempting to get not only felons to vote but felons that are currently incarcerated, as it's been revealed the DC Board of Elections has sent 2,400 incarcerated inmates voter registrations. It's very likely the attempt to steal the election by Democrats not just in DC, but possibly multiple Democrat controlled jurisdictions...As we are finding out Democrat controlled DC Board of Elections is now sending ballot applications to current incarcerated felons. <br />&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Democrats truly are trying every way to steal the 2020 election not by only their now exposed mail in voting scheme, but being revealed to the fact leaders in control of our nations capitol are now sending ballot applications to incarcerated felons. DOJ needs to investigate this development immediately, because we already understand it's against the law for felons to vote...And now it looks like Democrats are attempting to get felons behind bars to vote.</font><br /></div>

David Burkette of Montgomery was arrested today for a misdemeanor violation of the state&rsquo;s campaign finance law, Attorney General Steve Marshall announced. Burkette, 63,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/09/sen-david-burkette-resigns-from-alabama-senate.html" target="_blank" style="">resigned from the Senate&nbsp;</a>on Tuesday. Burkette is accused of intentionally depositing $3,625 in campaign contributions in his personal bank account instead of a campaign account in 2015 and 2016, when he was running for the Montgomery City Council. The charge is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $6,000. Burkette served on the Montgomery City Council from 2007 to 2018. Burkette is a Democrat and a former Montgomery public school teacher and coach. He was elected to the Senate in 2018.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now we have news breaking that a former Democrat State Rep. for the State of Alabama David Burkette has been arrested for one single campaign finance violaton, so I think we could use this news as a case against those in Washington who have been caught in campaign finance law violations. Alone when it comes to politicians in Washington caught in campaign finance violations, we have had blatant cases involving over a million dollars worth of campaign finance law violations when it comes to Reps. Omar and Ocasio-Cortez using campaign finances to fund the firms of their love ones and friends. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have this former Democrat State Rep. of Alabama being arrested for a single charge of campaign finance law violation, the DOJ and Federal agencies should use this case to go after those representing the country in Washington who are guilty of the same...But in some cases like AOC and Omar involves millions of dollars.</font></div>

Staff members from Secretary of State Bill Galvin&rsquo;s office have found around 3,000 uncounted ballots in Franklin, an office spokesperson&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/09/03/massachusetts-4th-congressional-district-thousands-of-ballots-found-in-franklin-jesse-mermells-campaign-solicits-recount-signatures/" target="_blank" style="">told the Boston Herald</a>. Previously, it was believed that the number of ballots not counted on Election Day was 600. The close race for a seat in 4th Congressional District has Jesse Mermell trailing Jake Auchincloss by nearly 1,400 votes, with 96 percent of precincts counted,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/09/03/mail-in-ballots-not-counted-franklin-massachusetts" target="_blank" style="">WBUR reported</a>.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Democrat establishment really has nothing left to support their virus mail in voting scheme, as issue after issue with mail in ballots keep showing up across America. Now we are seeing that thousands of ballots sent through the mail have shown up as uncounted in Massachusetts, just adding to the evidence that the Democrat mail in voting scheme cannot be trusted. Across the country in general over the last few weeks we have had multiple stories of the problems with mail in ballots, and there has likely now been well over one million mail in ballots across America highlighting the issues with mail in voting from rejected mail in ballots all the way to uncounted mail in ballots. It's not like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is helping the Democrat cause to support the Democrat virus mail in voting scheme, as she was caught this week out in public at a San Francisco hair salon getting her haircut while not wearing a mask. There's nothing that really supports the Democrat push for mail in voting.</font><br /></div>

Investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the state attorney general&rsquo;s office and other agencies executed the search warrant at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center northeast of Pittsburgh, said Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Western District.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Mt. Lebanon Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, another nursing home in the Pittsburgh area operated by the same company that owns Brighton, was also searched by authorities on Thursday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/fbi-agents-beaver-county-nursing-home-hit-hard-by-covid-19/NLHTIRMP2JEGRFBPF4KF34I3YM/" target="_blank" style="">NBC affiliate WPXI reported</a>. Brady did not offer details about the search warrant but he encouraged anyone with information about suspected fraud, abuse or victimization to contact a regional COVID-19 task force.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well just days after the DOJ announced it was going to start investigating states for coronavirus mandates that sent patients&nbsp;to nursing homes, the FBI has now raided a nursing home in the State of Pennsylvania where dozens showed up dead with the virus. The DOJ last week announced it was going to investigate states who virus mandates forced elderly virus patients&nbsp;into nursing homes, and this list involved Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania...So it now looks like the DOJ investigation has now gone active. With the news of the FBI raiding a nursing home in Pennsylvania where dozens died from the virus...Guarantee the Democrat governors of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Michigan won't sleep right for a few days.</font><br /></div>

This is proof right here that leadership, attorney's, and prosecutors in Portland, Oregon are doing everything they can to protect individuals involved with Antifa and Black Lives Matter, and are allowing the execution killer of a Trump supporter last week walk around free. It's time to send in Federal authorities into Portland if this killer is being allowed to walk the streets...Before Republicans see this and take justice into their own hands.</font>

Sharp pleaded not guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Cleveland to a six-count indictment that included charges of stealing mail, money laundering and drug conspiracy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are we as American's really supposed to trust the USPS with the 2020 election, when multiple USPS workers are getting charged and arrested for election crimes and even what looks to be a possible USPS drug trafficking ring. Well today it's been announced that a United States Postal Service worker has been charged Federally for stealing packages containing illicit drugs in a six count indictment, and this isn't the first time in the last month a United States Postal Service worker has been charged either locally or federally for stealing other peoples mail. <br />&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's reports like this that make it laughable that the Democrat establishment can even attempt their mail in voting scheme though the United States Postal Service, when multiple USPS workers are always getting arrested or Federally charged for stealing mail...When these very same type of USPS workers would come into direct contact with mail in ballots. This another reason that highlights the Democrat mail in voting scheme can't be trusted.</font><br /></div>

Today it has been announced by US Attorney&nbsp; Matt Martin that eight exploited and trafficked children have been rescued in North Carolina, so it looks like we are now up to over 70 trafficked and abducted children being rescued across the country in the last week. Also with this announcement this Federal operation announced by US Attorney Matt Martin where eight exploited children were rescued in North Carolina, also involved 23 arrests related to child exploitation and trafficking. This is now the third time in a week that Federal agencies&nbsp;and officials have announced the rescue of trafficked children, and once again complete silence from the Democrat media and the Democrat establishment.</font><br /></div>

The DOJ now reported as going after Google in the next several weeks with antitrust charges highlights how busy Federal law enforcement agencies have become in the last week, and the DOJ through&nbsp;AG Barr also announced that several voter fraud investigations in several states are now active. There are so many Federal investigations and Federal operations taking place across the country it's getting difficult to almost keep up with them all, but Google to be hit with antitrust charges will be very well deserved...As Google has been exposed as a tech giant who targets supporters of Trump and the right with major free speech violations and abuses.</font><br /></div>

Michael Reinoehl is being reportedly being investigated by Portland police over the killing of Aaron &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; Danielson, a member of the right wing group Patriot Prayer who was shot to death at a protest on Saturday.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reinoehl had previously claimed on social media and in an interview with Bloomberg that he &lsquo;was in the army&rsquo;. &lsquo;I was in the army and I hated it.

Reinoehl the Antifa member identified by 4-Chan anons a few days ago as the Portland shooter recently claimed on social media before the shooting that he was in the US ARMY, and now the US ARMY has investigated this claim by revealing they cannot find the service record of Michael Reinoehl. Generally this is how stupid Democrats and their supporters have always been, as when they make claims, then it's investigated, and always discovered as a lie. The Portland shooter not only should be Federally charged for an execution style killing of a Trump supporter, but should now face Federal prosecution for Stolen Valor.</font><br /></div>

The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB145" target="_blank" style="">SB 145</a>, the legislation &ldquo;would exempt from mandatory registration&rdquo; as a sex offender &ldquo;a person convicted of certain offenses involving minors if the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor and if that offense is the only one requiring the person to register.&rdquo; The measure would allow a judge to decide if an adult who engages in oral or anal sex with a child must register as a sex offender if that person is within ten years of the age of the victim.<br />&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The State of California obviously has a problem with crimes against children, and now the California State House controlled by California Democrats has passed a bill to decriminalize sex crimes against children. If this bill is signed into law as it heads to the desk of California Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom, then we should all declare Gavin Newsom as complicit and an accessory&nbsp;to any sex crime committed in California against a child. This bill in California once again highlights the Democrat establishment connection and obvious involvement in crimes against children, if a bill to allow the decriminalization of crimes against children is being passed in a Democrat controlled state house that is headed to the desk of a Democrat establishment Governor. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You have to wonder if this bill had lobbyists from the entertainment industry, as we all know Hollywood to also be deeply involved in crimes against children. Hopefully the US Marshals Operation Safety Net to rescue abducted and trafficked children is operational in California, because at any moment in California sex crimes against children will be decriminalized if this bill is signed by California Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom.</font></div>

Seattle-based Jeremy Vajko, 27, was arrested on Saturday night amid clashes between law enforcement officers and rioters. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, he drove recklessly near the Hay-Adams Hotel and drove &ldquo;into&nbsp;a crowd of over 100 individuals.&rdquo; Vajko, who reportedly<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/02/protester-arrested-in-dc-had-traveled-from-riots-in-portland-kenosha/" target="_blank" style="">&nbsp;worked for Microsoft until May</a>, was released from jail on Sunday and his charges have since been dropped.

We are starting to see that operatives of Black Lives Matter are being arrested in cities like Portland and Washington State, then only to have them show up in places like Kenosha, Wisconsin and our nations capitol for Antifa and Black Lives Matter activities. This shows the confirmation that Antifa and Black Lives Matter are being provided travel across America, and the DOJ has been revealed through&nbsp;Acting DHS head Chad Wolf that those funding these groups and providing travel to Antifa and Black Lives Matter operatives is being looked into. Remember that AG Barr when confirming Antifa operatives are being flown around the country, that crossing state lines to engage in riots anywhere is a Federal crime. Guarantee travel companies are well aware that this is going on across the country.</font><br /></div>

We know people who are flying around the country. We know where they&rsquo;re going.&rdquo; &ldquo;We see some of the purchases they are making before the riots of weapons to use in those riots,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;So, we are following them.&rdquo; Crossing state lines to engage in rioting is illegal and a federal offense, the attorney general said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A day after we found out the DOJ is investigating those who are funding riots across the country, AG Barr has personally confirmed that Antifa members are being flown around the country to take part in insurrection riots across the country. We could probably also say the same for Black Lives Matter, as a Black Lives Matter member from Indiana has been charged with 19 felonies in San Diego that involves attacking and gassing police. <br />&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is likely going to be a development where we see a major Federal operation conducted against Antifa at any moment and even possibly Black Lives Matter, because crossing state lines by any means like air travel to engage in rioting is a felony offense. With the DOJ investigation being announced as investigating the funding of Antifa and funding of the riots being announced likely meaning the source has been identified, the DOJ through Barr is stating those in Antifa flying around the country have been identified. This highlights how stupid groups like Antifa can be, because flying on commercial travel means you can easily be identified.&nbsp;</font><br /></div>

Now we are finding out an American firm who is a registered foreign agent to the Chinese Embassy received up to $350,000 in PPP loan money. There are issues with this coronavirus Payment Protection Program that keep showing up, and weeks ago we found out that Democrat organizations and Super Pacs also received Payment Protection Program loans as well. Not only is this a registered foreign agent of the Chinese embassy who serves as a propaganda organization for Beijing, but this very same group receieved $144,00 from the Chinese Embassy as well as over $300,000 from a Beijing linked "non-profit".</span><br /><br /><span></span></div>

Barr said he did not know the exact number. At least 32 people have been criminally convicted of voter fraud in 2019, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud" target="_blank" style="">database</a>&nbsp;maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the very same day we just found out that 19 non-citizens have been Federally charged for illegally voting in the 2016 Election, we now find out through AG Barr that the DOJ has several ongoing voter fraud investigations. Also with this reveal by AG Barr that the DOJ is investigating several large voter fraud investigations, AG Barr has also revealed that 32 people have been criminally&nbsp;convicted for voter fraud crimes in 2019. <br />&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;On this announcement directly through AG Barr we are now likely up to our 6th or 7th major Federal investigation/operation across the country...Starting to lose count, and guarantee the Democrat establishment is very paranoid behind the scenes that these major Federal investigations across the country are now targeting major voter fraud circles. This announcement of several voter fraud investigations now being announced by AG Barr involves multiple states.</font><br /></div>

Each defendant voted in a federal election in 2016, and one defendant also voted in 2018, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdnc/pr/federal-authorities-charge-nineteen-voter-fraud" target="_blank" style="">a news release</a>&nbsp;from United States Attorney Matthew G.T. Martin&rsquo;s office. In some instances, the defendants were also charged with related offenses such as making a false statement. The news release did not list the defendants&rsquo; nationalities or say how their alleged crimes had been uncovered, although it said the matters had been investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At a time when we are witnessing multiple children being rescued and child traffickers being taken care of by Federal authorities in mass, we are now seeing out of North Carolina where 19 non-citizens have been charged for illegally voting in the 2016 Election. With this development out of North Carolina charging 19 non-citizens for voting in the 2016 election, you can only wonder if more stories of non-citizens being Federally charged for voting in recent US Elections will start popping up in mass. <br />&#8203;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Just like with the children being rescued across America by a US Marshals Service operation, this development of 19 non-citizens being charged for voting in the 2016 Election is barely mentioned by the Democrat media and the Democrat establishment is completely silent. Starting to look like there are now multiple major Federal operations being carried out across the country that involve everything from child/human trafficking all the way up to this development of 19 non-citizens being charged for illegally voting in the 2016 Election.</font><br /></div>

Trump on Wednesday signed a five-page memo ordering all federal agencies to send reports to the White House Office of Management and Budget that detail funds that can be redirected. New York City, Washington, DC, Seattle and Portland are initial targets as Trump makes &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; a centerpiece of his reelection campaign after months of unrest and violence following the May killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Multiple Democrat controlled cities just got put on major notice for allowing violent riots to take place in their cities, and this move by Trump comes shortly after the RNC convention was violently attacked shortly after it ended in DC...And after the execution style killing of a Trump supporter in Portland during a Trump vehicle caravan. Democrats and their major controlled US cities are now experiencing&nbsp;major blowback for their actions of allowing violent rioters where we have seen arrested rioters immediately released after arrest, as Trump is now ordering the Federal government to pull funding from Washington DC, New York City, Portland, and Seattle...All cities under Democrat leadership that are allowing insurrection riots to take place since May. More cities will likely be added to the list of cities being defunded by the Federal government, and most of these Democrat controlled areas feeling the effect of this are all looking to defund police.</font><br /></div>

Bohai Harvest RST Shanghai Equity, an investment firm that Hunter Biden owns a stake in, initially invested in Megvii, a sanctioned Chinese tech company that specializes in facial recognition software, in 2017, according to the company&rsquo;s website.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The firm holds a nearly 2 percent stake in Megvii through two holding companies, according to a prospectus filed by Megvii as part of its application for a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Megvii to its list of sanctioned entities that were "implicated in human-rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups."<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Democrat establishment and Obama administration involvement&nbsp;with China is more obvious with each passing day, and now we find out the son of Joe Biden still has a stake in a Chinese company. We already understand the Biden family quid pro quo dealings with nations like China and Ukraine, however what makes this development more interesting highlighting the Biden family connection to China that took place under the Obama administration...Is that this Chinese company that Hunter Biden owns a stake in has been sanctioned by the US Government for human rights abuses.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That's right America the Biden family is profiting off of a Chinese company that is a known human rights abuser sanctioned by the US government&nbsp;for human rights abuses. Now that we know this couldn't the Trump administration take away Biden family assets as President Trump does have an executive order that takes away assets from individuals involved in human rights violations and abuses?</font><br /></div>

She wore a beige jacket with a blue shirt and jeans.</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/02/boulder-boy-assaulted-trump-sign/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=tw-denverpost&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" target="_blank" style=""><em>The Denver Post</em></a>&nbsp;reports: According to Boulder police, the assault occurred at 3 p.m. Monday at Folsom Street and Glenwood Drive. Police said the boy was riding his bicycle with the Trump sign when a woman on a moped saw the sign and turned around to confront the boy. Boulder police spokeswoman Shannon Aulabaugh said the suspect drove up to the boy and said something to the effect of &ldquo;you want something to look at,&rdquo; and used a closed fist to strike the boy in the back of the head and arms four to five times, and scratched him. The boy told police the woman then tried take the sign before leaving the scene.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raging adult Democrats seem to have a thing right now for attacking children across America who like Trump or whose families support Trump, as a raging white Democrat female adult has assaulted a child on a bike in Colorado over a Trump yard sign. Raging Democrats with their violent actions taking place all over America only show that the Democrat establishment is in some major trouble shortly ahead of the 2020 Election, and members of the Democrat establishment not all them are trying to squash their support for insurrection riots after three months of supporting the violent riots across America because polling is bad.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The desperation of the Democrat establishment and their vile voters really shows when they start attacking young kids in mass across the country over support for Trump. Not only is the Democrat establishment panicking, but Democrat voters are showing their panic as well with multiple assaults on children showing their support for Trump over the last couple of months across America.&nbsp;</font><br /></div>

Hamilton&nbsp;owned over 1,100 slaves over the years. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jamaicanfamilysearch.com/Members/slavereg.htm" style="">Jamaican slave registers from the National Archives, London</a>&nbsp;going back to the early 1800s, Hamilton owned babies as young as the one-month-old recorded in an 1817 registry.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few weeks back we all found out that Senator Harris had ancestors who owned slaves, but now we find out the Harris family roots in the slave trade involve a much larger number of slaves than previously reported. Senator Harris should be one of the very first Americans to pay reparations, as we are now finding out an ancestor of Senator Harris who is Biden's 2020 running mate actually owned around 1,100 slaves. Watch as we all find out that an ancestor of Senator Harris owned over 1,100 slaves during the slave trade in Jamaica, we probably will never hear ever again the word reparations out of the mouth of Senator Kamala Harris. If there is ever a debate between Trump and Biden before Election night 2020...President Trump should ask what Biden thinks about Senator Harris having to pay slave reparations since her roots trace back to over 1,100 slaves.</font><br /></div>
